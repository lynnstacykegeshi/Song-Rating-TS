This Python script prompts the user to compare all the songs from a selection of Taylor Swift albums and collects their preferences. It then calculates the average rating for each song and displays them in ranked order from highest to lowest. Additionally, it calculates the average rating for each album and displays them in order from highest to lowest.

To use the script, simply run it in your Python environment. You will be prompted to compare pairs of songs until all songs have been compared. At the end, the ranked lists of songs and albums will be displayed.

Note that the script requires the albums and songs to be defined in the albums dictionary at the beginning of the script. You can modify this dictionary to include your own selection of albums and songs.

Enjoy!
